# Pokemom Terminal Arena

Welcome! this is my most complex and best java program i have written so far. This is a terminal game. Here is a few things to know

- There is no save system this means that stopping the program will make you loose all progress and data.
- This game is not an official game by Nintendo. It's just a project i made to improve my coding skills and because a person close to me asked me to make this for them.

Now allow me to explain how to play:

there are multiple things to do in this game. Such being:
- catching and fighting wild pokemon
- fighting other opponent's pokemon
- fighting other opponent's pokemon in a ranked system
- going and interacting with pokeshops
- using codes to obtain items and 1 pokemon (coming soon)

# catching and fighting wild pokemon
 this option will allow you to go to "wild grass" to seek for pokemon to either catch or fight. You do require pokeballs to catch a pokemon. The rates on what type of pokemon spawns
 will vary based on your rank, as well as how effective a pokeball is. The higher the rank the better the chance of an evolve 2 or 3 pokemon spawns but with pros there's cons. In this 
 case the con is that your pokeball's efficeincy rate will also decrease as your rank goes higher (except masterballs).
 
 there are 20 pokemon varients (excluding their evolutions) to catch and fight.
 
# fighting other opponent's pokemon (casual)
  Casual fights are basically wild fights except you can't catch the pokemon. This is intended to be used when you do not wish to catch pokemon. The rate of the pokemons are the same 
  as the rates on the wild battles.

# fighting other opponent's pokemon (ranked)
  Ranked battles are where the real fun begins. You start off at rank 1 automatically, for each fight that you win you gain 5 xp and for each fight you loose you loose 10 xp. Having 
  negative xp is possible which means that is you loose too many battles you will have to not only try to rank up but get your xp back to atleats 0. In ranked battles the opponent will call
  a total of 3 pokemon. If you pokemon faints you will have the option to call another during the battle(this applies to all battles). There are a total of 3 tank levels. The higher the rank
  the harder the opponents get, so make sure to bring beefy pokemon to the battle. When you enter to go to the arena you will be given 2 options [1] battle or [2] exit this is your final 
  chance to go catch more pokemon or to heal your pokemon without it costing you 10 xp.
  
# going and interacting with pokeshops

  The pokeshop is a place where you can buy items such as health potions, pokeballs or you can also heal all your pokemon for free. Pokeshops are always avaliable except when fighting.

# using codes to obtain items and 1 pokemon (coming soon)
  Codes are a little system i'm currently working on. Codes will allow you to gain random items or if you enter the right code a surprise pokemon for a special someone.
  as of now the pokemon can be found in wild grass or battles to catch but this will change next update. 
  
# updates 
  The game will be updated every month around the 23rd. There will also be special updates on holidays where users can gain temporal items. These items will however be removed from the
  game the following update. But the User will be able to gain a badge for the event. 

that's about it for the explanation. Everything else should be self explanitory in the game. Thank you for playing and i hope you have fun!
